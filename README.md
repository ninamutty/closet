**Closet**
==============

Closet is an individual, personal project I created in order to help solve a daily problem of mine - deciding what to wear in the morning! I noticed that I often took precious time trying on different outfits and by the end of the ordeal my clothes would be strewn across my room. In an effort to make my life easier and cleaner, I created Closet - a Rails web-app to keep track of the outfits that I know I like!

##Challenges in Making Closet

**Challenges**
   
This was the first project I completed without the support system of my teachers, TA's, and peers at Ada. As a result, I got off to a slower start, but I am also much more confident in my abilities to problem solve individually.

**New Technologies**

  * AWS S3 Image Storage
  * Paperclip File Attachments
  * Facebook Oauth Login

##Next Steps

**Technologies**

 * After having more exposure to Javascript, I plan to utilize a Backbone front-end framework to increase the effeciency of my  site.
 * Convert to mobile (swift iOS)


**Features for the Future**

  * Implement an algorithm to show listed outfits weighted by the number of times it's been worn in the past, the last time it was worn, and whether or not it's a favorite.
  * Track weather data so that a user is only shown outfits that were worn in similar weather.
  * Improve responsiveness
